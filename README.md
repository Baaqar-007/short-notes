# Android Notes App

The **Android Notes App** is a straightforward application designed for Android devices. Its primary purpose is to allow users to create and manage short notes conveniently.

## Features

- **Native Codebase**: The app utilizes a native model of code in Android Studio, ensuring efficiency and compatibility with the Android platform.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are saved using `SharedPreferences`, which means they remain accessible even if the app is closed or re-opened.
- **No Server Configuration**: Unlike some note-taking apps that rely on external servers (e.g., Firebase), this project relies solely on native code.
- **Easy Setup**: To get started, simply open the project in Android Studio and run it.
